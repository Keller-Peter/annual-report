One-page overview of the projects with brief summary and ideally some icon to visually represent each project.

For each project we will add the incubation stage as a small visiual indicator using the badge.

Each project should address the following topics:

* Which domain, which business requirement does it address
* Which functionality
* Technology
* Adoption, community
* Potential, future perspective
* Reached milestones
